It is a calculator web app that allows users to perform basic mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, and more.

Key features include:

Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile.

Clear (C) button to reset the entire input.

Backspace (AC) button to delete the last character.

= button to calculate the result using JavaScriptâ€™s eval() function.

User-friendly layout with hover and click effects.

This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, CSS styling, and logic building in JavaScript.

I created this project to improve my skills, and I plan to keep enhancing it by adding new features like history tracking and advanced math functions.
